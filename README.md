### Problem
- The students waste their vacations because they don't know from where to study things that will help them in the next semester (or near future)
- Most students have a misconception about the courses. Many think that they will enjoy the next semester because of some courses. But face reality later (like ISS or IoT).
- The students are unaware of the prerequisites of a course and its speed. "Officially" the courses like CPro assumes no knowledge of programming, but we know how fast it goes and how many students struggle with it.

### Our Solution
- Our solution to this problem is to create a platform which shows the reality of the courses.
- Instead of scattered suggestions of the seniors, more organized suggestions (and learning resources) will help a student to utilize his/her vacation.
- They will prepare themselves according to the difficulty, duration and syllabus of a course by following suggestions given by seniors.

### Current Features
- A good looking, fully responsive website to enhance user experience.
- Functionality to bookmark a course and display in "My Courses". Data is stored in local storage.
- Course cards displaying info like tags, difficulty, duration and rating.
- A dedicated course page for the Syllabus, Resources and Suggestions/Comments of other students.
- All the course pages are made dynamically on request by the user.
- The app will automatically take data from a JSON file hosted on GitHub and render it.
- A working rating system (data stored in firebase).

### Our goals for near future
- Add more courses.
- Create a database for read/write operations.
- Use a self-made commenting system.
- Add functionality to create users account and store data like bookmarked courses globally.
- Allow users to post resources which will get uploaded after review.
- Allow users to request suggestions/resources from another user.
- Implement a search bar for courses for easier access.
- Recommendation System on the basis of tags.
